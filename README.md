# Topos

> A category theory-inspired functional programming language for the BEAM VM

## Overview

Topos is a research project exploring the design of a programming language that unifies category theory's mathematical rigor with the BEAM VM's legendary fault tolerance and concurrency capabilities. The language aims to make abstract mathematical concepts practical and accessible while leveraging the proven strengths of Erlang's runtime.

## Core Philosophy

Topos reimagines functional programming by making category theory concepts first-class language features rather than academic curiosities:

- **Shapes** instead of types - intuitive terminology for algebraic data types
- **Flows** instead of functions - emphasizing data transformation and composition
- **Composition as foundation** - the pipe operator `|>` and Kleisli composition `>>=` as primary abstractions
- **Immutability everywhere** - all data structures are immutable by default with persistent data structures
- **Actor model integration** - seamless blend of pure functional programming with BEAM's process model

## Key Features

### Category Theory Made Practical

- **Functors, Applicatives, and Monads** - simplified as "Mappable" and "Chainable" traits
- **Natural transformations** - first-class support for transforming between functors
- **Explicit effect system** - computational effects tracked through monads
- **Categorical laws** - property-based testing for algebraic properties

### BEAM-First Design

- **Process modules** - stateful computations as OTP processes
- **Supervision trees** - declarative fault tolerance
- **Hot code reloading** - leveraging BEAM's capabilities with pure function guarantees
- **Hex.pm integration** - seamless interoperability with Erlang/Elixir ecosystem

### Advanced Module System

- **ML-style parameterized modules (functors)** - inspired by OCaml and Standard ML
- **Three-level visibility control** - private, export, and public export
- **Signature-based abstraction** - interfaces separate from implementations
- **Category-as-module** - modules literally form categories with types as objects

### Developer Experience

- **Mandatory documentation** - first-class language construct with runtime introspection
- **Built-in testing** - property-based testing, doctests, and categorical law verification
- **Time-travel debugging** - leveraging immutability for reversible execution
- **FFI with safety** - category theory-based foreign function interface

### Standard Library: Category Theory Foundations

- **17 core abstractions** - Setoid, Ord, Semigroup, Monoid, Semigroupoid, Category, Functor, Apply, Applicative, Chain, Monad, Foldable, Traversable, Bifunctor, Extend, Comonad, Arrow
- **Dual notation system** - every operator has a readable keyword equivalent (`map`/`<$>`, `append`/`<>`, `bind`/`>>=`)
- **Beginner-friendly explanations** - complex mathematical concepts made accessible
- **Law verification** - automated property testing ensures implementations satisfy algebraic laws
- **Trait-based design** - general abstraction mechanism with `trait`, `instance`, `extends` keywords
- **Hierarchical organization** - Algebraic Structures → Categorical Structures → Functorial Hierarchy → Data Operations

### Distribution Layer: Partisan Integration

- **Scalable distribution** - replace Distributed Erlang's O(n²) full-mesh with pluggable topologies
- **Category-theoretic foundations** - network topologies as categories, membership operations as functors, messages as natural transformations
- **Named channels** - eliminate head-of-line blocking with multiple logical connections (12.5-38x throughput improvements)
- **Massive scale** - HyParView protocol enables 2,000+ node clusters vs Distributed Erlang's 60-200 node limit
- **Production-proven** - powers 30M+ daily GPS transmissions across 300K vehicles
- **Pluggable topologies** - full-mesh, peer-to-peer (HyParView), client-server, or custom overlays
- **Effect system integration** - topology selection and channel management through algebraic effects
- **Session types** - protocol-safe distributed communication with compile-time guarantees

## Project Status

⚠️ **This is a research project in early design phase**

Currently, the repository contains extensive research and design documentation exploring various language features. No compiler or runtime implementation exists yet.

## Example Code

```topos
-- Define a shape (algebraic data type)
shape User = {
  name: Text,
  age: Natural,
  email: Email
} derives [Eq, Show, Mappable]

-- Define a flow (pure function)
flow greet : User -> Text
flow greet user = "Hello, " <> user.name

-- Composition with the pipe operator
flow process_user : User -> Result Success Error
flow process_user =
  validate
  |> transform
  |> persist

-- Actor as immutable state machine
actor Counter = {
  shape State = { count: Natural }
  shape Message = Increment | Decrement | Get

  flow handle : Message -> State -> (State, Maybe Reply)
  flow handle = match
    | Increment, s -> ({ count: s.count + 1 }, None)
    | Decrement, s -> ({ count: s.count - 1 }, None)
    | Get, s       -> (s, Some s.count)
}
```

## Goals

1. **Demonstrate that category theory can be practical** - Make abstract mathematics accessible to working programmers
2. **Unify functional and distributed programming** - Show that pure functions and actor models complement rather than conflict
3. **Leverage existing ecosystems** - Build on the BEAM's 30+ years of production success rather than starting from scratch
4. **Make correctness convenient** - Design where the easiest path is also the correct path

## Non-Goals

- Replace Erlang or Elixir for existing projects
- Support every category theory concept (focus on practical subset)
- Create yet another general-purpose language without a clear niche
- Ignore performance or developer experience for theoretical purity

## Inspiration

Topos draws inspiration from:

- **Category theory** - Mathematical foundations for composition and abstraction
- **ML family** (OCaml, Standard ML, Haskell) - Module systems and type systems
- **BEAM languages** (Erlang, Elixir) - Concurrency and fault tolerance
- **Idris/Agda** - Dependent types and visibility control
- **Rust** - Safety guarantees and modern ergonomics
