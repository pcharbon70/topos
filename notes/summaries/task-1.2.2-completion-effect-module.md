## What Was Implemented

### Effect Module (`topos_infer_effect.erl`)

**Purpose:** Centralize effect-related operations for type inference

**Functionality:**

1. **Effect Construction**
   - `pure/0` - Create empty effect set
   - `from_list/1` - Create from list of effect atoms
   - `normalize/1` - Canonicalize (sort and deduplicate)

2. **Effect Combination**
   - `union/2` - Combine two effect sets
   - Commutative and associative
   - Automatic normalization

3. **Effect Checking**
   - `is_pure/1` - Check if effect set is empty
   - `subsumes/2` - Check if E1 ⊇ E2 (subset relation)
   - `compatible/2` - Check if effects can unify
   - `check_pure/2` - Verify expression has no effects

4. **Effect Inference**
   - `infer_expr_effects/1` - Infer effects from AST nodes
   - Currently all operations are pure (PoC)
   - Ready for extension when effectful operations added

**Key Algorithms:**

```erlang
% Effect Normalization
normalize({effect_set, Effects}) ->
    Normalized = lists:usort(Effects),
    {effect_set, Normalized}.

% Effect Union (with normalization)
union({effect_set, E1}, {effect_set, E2}) ->
    Combined = E1 ++ E2,
    normalize({effect_set, Combined}).

% Effect Subsumption
% E1 subsumes E2 if E2 ⊆ E1
subsumes({effect_set, E1}, {effect_set, E2}) ->
    sets:is_subset(sets:from_list(E2), sets:from_list(E1)).

% Effect Compatibility (monomorphic - must be equal)
compatible(E1, E2) ->
    normalize(E1) =:= normalize(E2).
```

## Integration with Type Inference

### How Effects Work in the System

1. **Function Types Include Effects:**
   ```erlang
   {tfun, FromType, ToType, {effect_set, [io, state]}}
   ```

2. **Unification Checks Effect Compatibility:**
   ```erlang
   % In topos_infer_unify.erl
   unify({tfun, From1, To1, E1}, {tfun, From2, To2, E2}) ->
       % ... unify From1 with From2, To1 with To2 ...
       case topos_infer_effect:compatible(E1, E2) of
           true -> ok;
           false -> {error, effect_mismatch(E1, E2)}
       end.
   ```

3. **Expression Inference Tracks Effects:**
   ```erlang
   % Lambda creates pure function by default
   infer({lam, Param, Body}, Env, State) ->
       % ... infer body ...
       {tfun, ParamType, BodyType, topos_infer_effect:pure()}.
   ```

4. **Future: Effectful Operations:**
   ```erlang
   % When we add perform operations:
   infer({perform, io, _}, Env, State) ->
       Effects = topos_infer_effect:from_list([io]),
       % ... infer with effects ...
   ```

## PoC Design Decisions

### Monomorphic Effects

**Decision:** Effects are concrete sets, not polymorphic

**Why:**
- Simpler implementation for proof-of-concept
- No need for effect variables or effect constraints
- Sufficient to demonstrate effect tracking concept

**Limitation:**
- Can't express "pure or effectful" polymorphically
- Can't have effect-polymorphic functions

**Example:**
```erlang
% This works (monomorphic effects):
id : ∀α. α → α !{}

% This doesn't work yet (polymorphic effects):
map : ∀α β ε. (α → β !ε) → List α → List β !ε
```

### All Expressions Currently Pure

**Decision:** Expression inference returns pure effects for all forms

**Why:**
- We don't have effectful operations yet (no `perform`, IO, etc.)
- Effect tracking infrastructure is ready
- Easy to extend when we add effectful operations

**Future Extension:**
```erlang
% Will add patterns like:
infer_expr_effects({perform, io, _}) -> from_list([io]);
infer_expr_effects({perform, state, _}) -> from_list([state]);
infer_expr_effects({async, _}) -> from_list([async]);
```

## Key Features

### Effect Normalization
```erlang
Effects1 = from_list([state, io, exn]),
Effects2 = from_list([exn, state, io]),
% Both normalize to {effect_set, [exn, io, state]}
```

### Effect Subsumption
```erlang
SuperSet = from_list([io, state, exn]),
SubSet = from_list([io, state]),

% SuperSet ⊇ SubSet
subsumes(SuperSet, SubSet)  % true

% Useful for subtyping:
% Function with effects {io, state, exn} can be used
% where function with effects {io, state} is expected
```

### Effect Union
```erlang
E1 = from_list([io]),
E2 = from_list([state]),
Combined = union(E1, E2),
% Result: {effect_set, [io, state]}
```

4. **Documentation**
   - Clear API for effect operations
   - Type specifications

## What's Ready for Future

The effect module provides hooks for future enhancements:

### Effect Variables (Polymorphism)
```erlang
% Could extend effect_set to include variables:
-type effect_set() ::
    {effect_set, [atom()]} |           % Current
    {effect_var, pos_integer()} |      % Future
    {effect_union, effect_set(), effect_set()}.  % Future
```

### Effect Constraints
```erlang
% Could track constraints during inference:
-type effect_constraint() ::
    {subsumes, effect_set(), effect_set()} |
    {equals, effect_set(), effect_set()}.
```

### Effect Operations
```erlang
% Ready to add when needed:
infer_expr_effects({perform, Effect, _}) ->
    from_list([Effect]).

infer_expr_effects({handle, Expr, Handlers}) ->
    % Remove handled effects from Expr's effects
    remove_effects(infer_expr_effects(Expr), handled_effects(Handlers)).
```
