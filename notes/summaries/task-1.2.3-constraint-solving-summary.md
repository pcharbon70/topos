**Branch:** `feature/task-1.2.3-constraint-solving`
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Phase:** 1 (Core Language Infrastructure)
**Section:** 1.2 (Core Type System)

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive constraint solving system for the Topos compiler, extending Algorithm W with trait (type class) constraints and algebraic effect handler verification. This task completes the foundation for Topos's category-theory-first approach and validates effect handlers.

## Completed Subtasks

### ✅ Subtask 1.2.3.1 - Trait Constraint Representation

**Module:** `topos_constraint.erl`
**Tests:** `topos_constraint_tests.erl`
**Lines of Code:** ~320 (module) + ~240 (tests)

**Features Implemented:**
- Constraint data structures for trait requirements
- Constraint set operations (add, simplify, normalize, remove duplicates)
- Type substitution for constraints
- Query functions (find by variable, filter by trait, check membership)
- Full integration with `topos_infer_state` for constraint tracking

**Key Functions:**
- `trait_constraint/2,3` - Create trait constraints
- `simplify/1` - Remove duplicates and normalize
- `substitute/2` - Apply type substitutions to constraints
- `type_vars/1` - Extract type variables from constraints

### ✅ Subtask 1.2.3.2 - Instance Resolution

**Module:** `topos_instance.erl`
**Tests:** `topos_instance_tests.erl`
**Lines of Code:** ~280 (module) + ~280 (tests)

**Features Implemented:**
- Instance database (maps traits to implementations)
- Single and batch constraint resolution
- Polymorphic instance matching via unification
- Ambiguity detection (multiple matching instances)
- Instance overlap checking

**Key Functions:**
- `make_instance/2,3` - Create trait instances
- `resolve_constraint/2` - Resolve single constraint
- `resolve_constraints/2` - Batch resolution
- `unify_instance/2` - Match instance with constraint
- `find_matching_instances/2` - Filter candidates by trait and arity
- `check_overlap/2` - Detect overlapping instances

**Resolution Algorithm:**
1. Find instances matching trait name and arity
2. Attempt unification with each candidate
3. Return unique match with substitution
4. Error if no match or multiple matches (ambiguous)

**Test Coverage:** 20+ test cases covering simple resolution, polymorphic resolution, ambiguity detection, batch resolution, instance queries, and realistic scenarios (Functor, Monad).

---

### ✅ Subtask 1.2.3.3 - Constraint Simplification

**Status:** Implemented in `topos_constraint` module
**Implementation:** `simplify/1`, `normalize/1`, `remove_duplicates/1`

**Features:**
- Remove duplicate constraints from sets
- Normalize constraint sets (canonical ordering)
- Simplify constraint sets (duplicates + normalization)
- Type-aware structural comparison for sorting

**Simplification Process:**
1. Remove exact duplicates
2. Sort by trait name alphabetically
3. Sort by type arguments structurally
4. Return canonical form

---

### ✅ Subtask 1.2.3.4 - Coherence Checking

**Module:** `topos_coherence.erl`
**Tests:** `topos_coherence_tests.erl`
**Lines of Code:** ~250 (module) + ~270 (tests)

**Features Implemented:**
- Full database coherence verification
- Incremental instance checking (before adding)
- Overlap detection for instance pairs
- Coverage checking for missing instances
- Detailed error reporting with source locations

**Key Functions:**
- `check_instance_db/1` - Verify entire database

- `find_overlaps/2` - Find overlapping instances
- `check_coverage/2` - Detect missing instances
- `format_overlap_error/2`, `format_coverage_error/2` - Error formatting

**Coherence Rules:**
1. No overlapping instances for same trait
2. Instance heads must not unify (except identical instances)
3. Different traits never overlap
4. Specific instances don't conflict with distinct types

**Test Coverage:** 20+ test cases covering coherent databases, incoherent databases, new instance checking, overlap detection, coverage checking, error formatting, and complex scenarios.

### ✅ Subtask 1.2.3.5 - Effect Handler Verification

**Module:** `topos_handler_verify.erl`
**Tests:** `topos_handler_verify_tests.erl`
**Lines of Code:** ~280 (module) + ~240 (tests)

**Features Implemented:**
- Full handler verification against effect declarations
- Exhaustiveness checking (all operations handled)
- Arity checking (parameters match declarations)
- Unknown operation detection
- Effect resolution (removing handled effects from effect sets)

**Key Functions:**
- `verify_handler/2` - Complete verification
- `check_exhaustiveness/2` - Ensure all operations handled
- `check_operation_types/3` - Verify arities and types
- `resolve_handled_effects/2` - Remove handled effects
- `format_handler_error/1` - Error formatting

**Verification Process:**
1. Check all declared operations have handlers
2. Verify handler arities match operation arities
3. Detect unknown operations in handlers
4. Collect all errors for reporting
5. Resolve handled effects from effect sets

**Error Types:**
- `missing_operation` - Operation not handled
- `arity_mismatch` - Wrong number of parameters
- `unknown_operation` - Handler for non-existent operation
- `type_mismatch` - Type incompatibility (for future)

**Test Coverage:** 15+ test cases covering exhaustiveness, arity checking, unknown operations, full verification, effect resolution, error formatting, and complex scenarios.

## Integration with Existing System

### Extended Modules

**`topos_infer_state.erl`** - Added constraint tracking:
- New field: `constraints :: constraint_set()`
- Functions: `add_constraint/2`, `add_constraints/2`, `get_constraints/1`
- Functions: `clear_constraints/1`, `substitute_constraints/1`
- Ensures constraints stay in sync with type substitutions

**`Makefile`** - Updated build system:
- Added all 4 new modules to compile list
- Added all 4 test modules to test list
- Removed reference to deleted `topos_type_state.erl`
- Added missing `topos_config.erl`

---

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Constraint Representation
- Constraints are simple tuples: `{trait, TraitName, TypeArgs, Loc}`
- Location tracking for all errors
- Constraint sets are lists (simple, functional)
- Normalization provides canonical form for comparison

### 2. Instance Resolution
- Database is a map: `TraitName => [Instance]`
- Organized by trait for O(1) lookup by name
- Unification-based matching for polymorphic instances
- Explicit error handling (no instance, ambiguous)

### 3. Coherence Strategy
- Pairwise overlap checking for all instances
- Unification test for overlap detection
- Separate coherence and coverage checking
- Helpful error messages with suggestions

### 4. Effect Handler Verification
- Exhaustiveness as primary check
- Arity checking before full type inference
- Effect resolution through set subtraction
- Future-ready for type checking integration

---

## Testing Strategy

All modules include comprehensive test suites:

**Unit Tests:**
- Construction and basic operations
- Core algorithms (resolution, simplification)
- Query and filter functions
- Error cases and edge cases

**Integration Tests:**
- Complex workflows
- Multiple constraints/instances
- Realistic scenarios (Functor, Monad, IO)
- Nested operations

**Error Testing:**
- All error types covered
- Error message formatting verified
- Source location tracking tested

---

## Known Limitations

1. **No Runtime Integration:** Constraint solving not yet integrated with main type inference pipeline
2. **Manual Instance Database:** No automatic instance discovery from parsed code
3. **Limited Type Checking:** Handler verification checks arities but not full types yet
4. **No Backtracking:** Instance resolution finds first match, no search strategy
5. **No Instance Derivation:** Instances must be explicitly declared
6. **Monomorphic Effects:** No effect polymorphism (deferred to Phase 6)

---

## Future Work

### Next Steps (Task 1.2.4+):
- Integrate constraint solving with Algorithm W
- Generate constraints during type inference
- Add constraint solving after unification
- Implement instance derivation for common traits
- Connect to parser for effect/trait declarations

### Phase 6 Enhancements:
- Effect polymorphism with effect variables
- Advanced effect inference algorithms
- Effect handler composition
- Optimized effect runtime
