# Topos Language Guide

## Introduction

Topos is a new functional programming language for the BEAM virtual machine that fundamentally grounds itself in category theory principles. Unlike traditional functional languages that add categorical concepts as libraries, Topos makes category theory the foundation from which all language features emerge naturally. This creates a unique synthesis where mathematical rigor meets practical distributed systems programming.

**Note**: This guide focuses on core language features. For information about standard library abstractions (Functor, Monad, operators, etc.), see the [Standard Library Guide](../guides/standard-library-overview.md).

## Core Philosophy

In Topos, **everything is a category**. Programs are compositions of morphisms (which we call "flows"), data flows through immutable transformations, and side effects are handled through algebraic effect handlers. The language treats the BEAM's actor model as a natural categorical structure, making distributed programming both type-safe and mathematically sound.

## Fundamental Concepts and Keywords

### 1. Shapes (Objects in Category Theory)

Shapes define data types as objects in a category. They are immutable by construction and support algebraic data types.

```topos
-- Product types (records)
shape User = {
  name: Text,
  age: Natural,
  email: Email
} deriving [Eq, Show, Doc]

-- Sum types (variants)
shape Result a b = Ok a | Error b

-- Recursive types
shape List a = Nil | Cons a (List a)
```

### 2. Flows (Morphisms)

Flows are pure functions that represent morphisms between objects. They compose naturally and preserve categorical properties.

> **Note**: Updated to include type class constraints using `=>` syntax for trait-bounded polymorphism.

```topos
-- Basic flow definition
flow greet : User -> Text
flow greet user = Text.concat "Hello, " user.name

-- Composition using pipe operator
flow processUser : User -> Result User ValidationError
flow processUser =
  validate |> normalize |> store

-- Type class constraints (see Standard Library guide for Functor/Monad)
flow double : List Natural -> List Natural
flow double xs = List.map (* 2) xs

-- Polymorphic functions with constraints
flow total : Num a => List a -> a
flow total xs = List.fold (+) 0 xs
```

### 3. Trait System (Type Classes)

> **Note**: This section replaces the previous "Categories and Modules" section. The trait system provides a general mechanism for type classes, replacing ad-hoc polymorphism with principled abstractions. Categories are still used for module organization (see Module System section below).

Traits define type classes with laws that implementations must satisfy. This is the foundation for all category theory abstractions in Topos.

```topos
-- Define a trait
trait Setoid a where
  -- Type class methods
  equals : a -> a -> Bool

  -- Default implementations
  not_equals : a -> a -> Bool
  not_equals x y = not (equals x y)

-- Define operators for traits
operator (===) = equals
operator (!==) = not_equals

-- Trait hierarchies with extends
trait Ord a extends Setoid a where
  compare : a -> a -> Ordering

  -- Derived operations
  less_than : a -> a -> Bool
  less_than x y = compare x y == LT

-- Higher-kinded traits with kind annotations
trait Functor (f : Type -> Type) where
  fmap : (a -> b) -> f a -> f b

-- Trait laws (verified by property testing)
laws Functor f where
  property "identity" =
    forall x : f a ->
      fmap identity x === x

  property "composition" =
    forall x : f a, g : (a -> b), h : (b -> c) ->
      fmap (h . g) x === (fmap h . fmap g) x
```

#### Core Language Operators

The language includes minimal built-in operators:

| Trait | Description | Keyword | Operator |
|-------|-------------|---------|----------|
| Setoid | Type-level equality | `equals` | `===` |
| Setoid | Type-level inequality | `not_equals` | `!==` |

**Note**: Comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`) are built into the language for convenience. Other trait-based operators (Functor `<$>`, Monad `>>=`, Semigroup `<>`, etc.) are defined in the [Standard Library](../guides/standard-library-overview.md).

### 4. Instances (Trait Implementations)

Instances provide concrete implementations of traits for specific types.

```topos
-- Simple instance
instance Setoid Natural where
  equals = (==)

-- Instance with constraints
instance Setoid a => Setoid (List a) where
  equals Nil Nil = True
  equals (Cons x xs) (Cons y ys) = x === y && xs === ys
  equals _ _ = False

-- Instance for Maybe
instance Setoid a => Setoid (Maybe a) where
  equals None None = True
  equals (Some x) (Some y) = x === y
  equals _ _ = False
```

### 5. Operators

Topos includes minimal built-in operators for type-level equality:

```topos
-- Type-level equality (built into language)
operator (===) = equals      -- Setoid equality
operator (!==) = not_equals  -- Setoid inequality
```

Comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`) are also built into the language for convenience.

**Note**: Other operators (Functor `<$>`, Monad `>>=`, Semigroup `<>`, composition operators, etc.) are defined in the [Standard Library](../guides/standard-library-overview.md) as library functions, not built into the language grammar.

### 6. Categories and Modules

Modules organize code into categories with explicit structure. Modules can also group trait definitions and instances.

> **Note**: Updated to integrate with the trait system.

```topos
-- Module with types and functions
category Collections = {
  -- Objects (types)
  export shape List a
  export shape Set a

  -- Morphisms (flows)
  export flow map : (a -> b) -> List a -> List b
  export flow filter : (a -> Bool) -> List a -> List a
  export flow fold : (a -> b -> b) -> b -> List a -> b
}

-- Module for trait definitions
module Data.Ordering where
  export trait Ord a where
    compare : a -> a -> Ordering

  export shape Ordering = LT | EQ | GT

-- Module for instances
module Data.Natural.Instances where
  import Data.Ordering (Ord, Ordering)

  instance Ord Natural where
    compare x y =
      if x < y then LT
      else if x > y then GT
      else EQ
```

### 8. Effects and Handlers

Side effects are managed through algebraic effect handlers, making them explicit in types.

```topos
-- Define an effect
effect FileIO = {
  read : Path -> String,
  write : Path -> String -> Unit
}

-- Use effects with perform keyword
flow loadConfig : Path -> Config / {FileIO}
flow loadConfig path = do
  content <- perform FileIO.read(path)
  return parseConfig(content)

-- Handle effects
handle loadConfig("app.toml") with
  FileIO.read(p) -> readFromDisk(p)
  FileIO.write(p, c) -> writeToDisk(p, c)
end

-- Trait-based effects
trait MonadIO (m : Type -> Type) where
  liftIO : IO a -> m a
```

### 9. Actors and Processes

BEAM processes are first-class with categorical structure.

```topos
actor Counter = {
  shape State = { count: Natural }
  shape Message = Increment | Decrement | Get

  flow init : Unit -> State
  flow init () = { count: 0 }

  flow handle : Message -> State -> (State, Maybe Reply)
  flow handle msg state = match msg
    | Increment -> ({ count: state.count + 1 }, None)
    | Decrement -> ({ count: state.count - 1 }, None)
    | Get -> (state, Some state.count)
  end
}
```

### 10. Pattern Matching

Advanced pattern matching with categorical foundations.

```topos
flow process : Message -> Response
flow process = match
  -- View patterns
  | parse_json -> Ok(data) -> handle_data(data)

  -- Or-patterns
  | Error(e) | Failure(e) -> handle_error(e)

  -- Pattern guards with bindings
  | Request(data) when validate(data) -> Valid(v) ->
    process_valid(v)

  -- Pattern synonyms
  | Success(result) -> return_success(result)
end
```

### 11. Documentation as First-Class

Documentation is mandatory and introspectable.

> **Note**: Extended to include documentation of trait laws.

```topos
doc "Calculates the distance between two points"
doc params {
  p1: "First point in 2D space",
  p2: "Second point in 2D space"
}
doc returns "Euclidean distance as Float"
doc examples """
  distance({x: 0, y: 0}, {x: 3, y: 4}) == 5.0
"""
flow distance : Point -> Point -> Float
flow distance p1 p2 =
  sqrt((p2.x - p1.x)^2 + (p2.y - p1.y)^2)

-- Documentation for trait instances
doc """
  Setoid instance for List ensures structural equality:
  - Reflexivity: xs === xs
  - Symmetry: xs === ys implies ys === xs
  - Transitivity: xs === ys and ys === zs implies xs === zs
"""
instance Setoid a => Setoid (List a) where
  equals = List.equal_by equals
```

### 12. Testing as Language Primitive

> **Note**: Significantly expanded to include laws, property testing, verification, test suites, and benchmarking.

Tests are built into the language, not annotations. Topos provides multiple levels of testing from unit tests to property-based testing to automated law verification.

```topos
-- Unit tests
test "distance calculation" =
  let origin = {x: 0, y: 0}
  let point = {x: 3, y: 4}
  assert distance(origin, point) == 5.0

-- Property-based testing
property "distance is symmetric" =
  forall p1 p2 : Point ->
    distance(p1, p2) === distance(p2, p1)

-- Conditional properties with where clause
property "positive numbers have positive squares" =
  forall x : Natural where x > 0 ->
    x * x > 0

-- Law verification for traits
test "List satisfies Functor laws" =
  verify laws Functor for List

test "Maybe is a valid Monad" =
  verify laws Monad for Maybe

-- Test suites for organization
suite "Collection Operations" where
  test "map preserves length" =
    forall xs : List Natural ->
      List.length (List.map (+1) xs) == List.length xs

  test "filter reduces or maintains length" =
    forall xs : List Natural, p : (Natural -> Bool) ->
      List.length (List.filter p xs) <= List.length xs

  property "reverse is involutive" =
    forall xs : List a ->
      List.reverse (List.reverse xs) === xs

-- Benchmarks for performance testing
benchmark "fold performance" = {
  baseline: {
    "left fold": measure -> List.fold_left (+) 0 largeList,
    "right fold": measure -> List.fold_right (+) 0 largeList
  },

  requirements: {
    "fold under 100ms": time < 100.ms,
    "memory under 10MB": heap_growth < 10.mb
  }
}

benchmark "map vs manual recursion" = {
  baseline: {
    "using map": measure -> List.map (*2) numbers,
    "manual recursion": measure -> double_recursive numbers
  }
}
```

### 13. Type System Features

Advanced types with categorical grounding.

> **Note**: Extended with higher-kinded types, kind annotations, and multiple type class constraints.

```topos
-- Row polymorphism
flow getX : {x: Float | ρ} -> Float
flow getX record = record.x

-- Type families
type family Append xs ys where
  Append [] ys = ys
  Append (x:xs) ys = x : Append xs ys

-- Existential types
shape AbstractSet a = exists r. {
  rep: r,
  empty: r,
  insert: a -> r -> r,
  member: a -> r -> Bool
}

-- Higher-kinded types with kind annotations
trait Functor (f : Type -> Type) where
  fmap : (a -> b) -> f a -> f b

trait Bifunctor (p : Type -> Type -> Type) where
  bimap : (a -> c) -> (b -> d) -> p a b -> p c d

-- Multiple type class constraints
flow traverse : (Traversable t, Applicative f) => (a -> f b) -> t a -> f (t b)

-- Constraint syntax in forall (for properties/laws)
laws Setoid a where
  property "symmetry" =
    forall x : a, y : a where x === y ->
      y === x
```

### 14. Immutability and Updates

All data is immutable with structured update syntax.

```topos
-- Update with 'with' keyword
flow birthday : User -> User
flow birthday user =
  user with { age = user.age + 1 }

-- Optics for nested updates
flow updateCity : Text -> Person -> Person
flow updateCity newCity =
  Person.address.city.set newCity
```

## Complete Syntax Examples

**Note**: Examples of standard library abstractions (Functor, Applicative, Monad, etc.) have been moved to the [Standard Library Guide](../guides/standard-library-overview.md). This section focuses on core language features.

### Session Types for Protocol Safety

```topos
-- Define a session protocol
session TwoPhaseCommit =
  !prepare -> ?vote ->
  choice {
    commit -> !finalize -> end,
    abort -> !rollback -> end
  }

-- Implement session
flow coordinator : Session[TwoPhaseCommit] -> Result
flow coordinator session = do
  send session Prepare
  vote <- receive session
  match vote
    | Ready ->
      select session commit
      send session Finalize
      Ok
    | NotReady ->
      select session abort
      send session Rollback
      Aborted
  end
```

### DSL Creation

```topos
-- Define a DSL
dsl MatrixDSL : Category where
  -- Grammar
  grammar Matrix where
    syntax "[[ _ ]]" : Matrix where
      [[ a, b; c, d ]] = Matrix 2 2 [[a,b], [c,d]]

  -- Operations
  operator (×) = matrix_multiply
  operator (ᵀ) = transpose [postfix]

  -- Laws
  law transpose_multiply:
    (A × B)ᵀ == Bᵀ × Aᵀ
```

flow validateCart cart = do
  ensure (not List.empty cart.items)
    "Cart cannot be empty"

  ensure (all validQuantity cart.items)
    "Invalid item quantities"

  Ok cart
where
  validQuantity item = item.quantity > 0

-- Price calculation with row polymorphism
flow calculateTotal : {items: List OrderItem | ρ} -> Money
flow calculateTotal order =
  List.foldl (\acc item ->
    acc + (item.price * item.quantity)
  ) (Money 0) order.items

-- Order state machine with pattern matching

    | GetOrder id ->
      (state, Map.lookup id state.orders)

    | GetMetrics ->
      (state, Some state.metrics)
  end
}

  strategy: one_for_one,
  intensity: 10,
  period: 60,

  children: [
    {
      id: order_processor,

### Module 7: Testing

> **Note**: Expanded with law verification, test suites, and benchmarks.

```topos
module Store.Test where
import Store.Service
import Store.Domain

-- Property-based testing for business logic
property "cart total is sum of items" =
  forall items : List CartItem ->
    calculateTotal {items: items} ===
    List.sum (List.map itemTotal items)
  where
    itemTotal item = item.price * item.quantity

-- Effect testing with mock handlers
test "checkout reserves inventory" = do
  let cart = {
    customer: testCustomer,
    items: [{product: pid1, quantity: 2}]
  }

  let inventoryOps = ref []

  -- Run with mock handlers
  result <- handle checkout(cart) with
    Database.insert(_) -> ()
    Database.update(_, _) -> ()

    Payment.charge(_, amount) ->
      assert amount === Money 200
      Success(txn123)

    Email.send(_, _) -> ()

    Inventory.check(pid) ->
      assert pid === pid1
      return 10  -- Plenty in stock

    Inventory.reserve(pid, qty) ->
      inventoryOps := (pid, qty) :: !inventoryOps
      return true
  end

  -- Verify inventory was reserved
  assert !inventoryOps === [(pid1, 2)]
  assert result matches Ok(_)
end

-- Actor testing
test actor "order processor handles concurrent orders" = do
  let processor = spawn_test OrderProcessor.init()

  -- Send multiple orders concurrently
  parallel [
    processor ! ProcessOrder(cart1),
    processor ! ProcessOrder(cart2),
    processor ! ProcessOrder(cart3)
  ]

  wait_idle processor

  -- Verify all processed
  metrics <- processor ?? GetMetrics
  assert metrics.total === 3
end

-- Test suite organization
suite "Order Validation Tests" where
  test "empty cart is rejected" =
    assert validateCart emptyCart === Error "Cart cannot be empty"

  test "zero quantity is rejected" =
    let cart = {items: [{product: p1, quantity: 0}]}
    assert validateCart cart === Error "Invalid item quantities"

  property "valid carts pass validation" =
    forall cart : Cart where all (\i -> i.quantity > 0) cart.items ->
      validateCart cart matches Ok(_)

-- Benchmark testing
benchmark "checkout performance" = {
  baseline: {
    "simple checkout":

### Module 8: DSL for Business Rules

```topos
module Store.Rules where

-- Define a DSL for business rules

### Module 9: Main Application

```topos
module Store.Main where
import Store.{OrderProcessor, API, Service}

-- Main application with effect handling
flow main : Unit -> Unit / {}
flow main () = do
  -- All effects must be handled
  handle runApplication() with
    -- Production handlers
    Database.query(q) -> PostgreSQL.execute(q)
    Database.insert(x) -> PostgreSQL.insert(x)
    Database.update(id, x) -> PostgreSQL.update(id, x)
    Database.delete(id) -> PostgreSQL.delete(id)

    Payment.charge(card, amount) ->
      StripeAPI.charge(card, amount)
    Payment.refund(txn, amount) ->
      StripeAPI.refund(txn, amount)

    Email.send(addr, template) ->

    Inventory.check(pid) ->
      InventoryDB.getStock(pid)
    Inventory.reserve(pid, qty) ->
      InventoryDB.reserve(pid, qty)
    Inventory.release(pid, qty) ->
      InventoryDB.release(pid, qty)

  -- Start web server
  HttpServer.start(port: 8080) { request ->
    match request.path
      | "/api/session" ->

## Key Language Features Summary

> **Note**: Expanded to include trait system, operators, law verification, and benchmarking.

### Category Theory Integration
- **Objects and Morphisms**: Types and functions as categorical structures
- **Traits and Instances**: Type classes with lawful abstractions
- **Higher-Kinded Types**: Type constructors as first-class with kind annotations
- **Natural Transformations**: Structure-preserving conversions between type constructors
- **Limits and Colimits**: Products, coproducts, and universal constructions
- **Standard Library Abstractions**: Functor, Applicative, Monad (see Standard Library guide)

### Type System
- **Trait System**: General abstraction mechanism with `trait`, `instance`, `extends`
- **Higher-Kinded Types**: Explicit kind annotations `f : Type -> Type`
- **Type Class Constraints**: Single and multiple constraints with `=>`
- **Row Polymorphism**: Extensible records and variants
- **Polymorphic Variants**: Open sum types
- **Type Families**: Type-level computation
- **Singleton Types**: Bridge between types and values
- **Existential Types**: Abstract data types
- **Session Types**: Protocol-safe communication

### Effects and Purity
- **Algebraic Effects**: First-class effect definitions
- **Effect Handlers**: Flexible effect interpretation
- **Pure by Default**: Explicit effect annotations
- **Effect Polymorphism**: Generic over effects
- **Type-Safe I/O**: Effects tracked in types
- **Trait-Based Effects**: Effects as type classes (e.g., MonadIO)

### Operators
- **Type-Level Equality**: `===`, `!==` for Setoid equality (built into language)
- **Comparison**: `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` (built into language for convenience)
- **Standard Library Operators**: Available as library functions (see [Standard Library](../guides/standard-library-overview.md))
  - Functor/Applicative/Monad: `fmap`/`<$>`, `apply`/`<*>`, `bind`/`>>=`
  - Composition: Kleisli, Category morphisms
  - Arrow, Comonad operators

### Testing and Verification
- **Unit Tests**: Basic `test` blocks
- **Property Testing**: `property` with `forall` quantification
- **Law Verification**: `verify laws Trait for Type` - automated checking
- **Test Suites**: `suite` for organizing related tests
- **Benchmarks**: `benchmark` with baselines and requirements
- **Conditional Properties**: Properties with `where` constraints

### Concurrency and Distribution
- **Actor Model**: Type-safe processes
- **Supervision Trees**: Categorical fault tolerance
- **Hot Code Reloading**: Version migration as functors
- **Distributed Types**: Location-transparent computation
- **Choreographic Programming**: Global protocol definitions

### Developer Experience
- **Mandatory Documentation**: Machine-checkable docs
- **First-Class Testing**: Tests as language primitives
- **Property Testing**: Automated law verification
- **Pattern Matching**: Advanced patterns with categorical semantics
- **DSL Creation**: Grammar definition and metaprogramming
- **Standard Library**: Rich functional abstractions (Functor, Monad, etc.)

### BEAM Integration
- **Process Isolation**: Each actor has independent heap
- **Message Passing**: Type-safe communication
- **Fault Tolerance**: Let-it-crash with types
- **Distribution**: Transparent node communication
- **Performance**: Zero-cost abstractions where possible

## Conclusion

Topos represents a unique synthesis of mathematical rigor and practical distributed systems programming. By making category theory the foundation rather than an addition, it enables developers to write code that is simultaneously:

- **Mathematically Sound**: Verified by categorical laws through property testing
- **Practically Useful**: Running on battle-tested BEAM
- **Type Safe**: Catching errors at compile time with advanced type system
- **Concurrent**: Leveraging actors and supervision
- **Testable**: With built-in testing, property verification, and benchmarking
- **Maintainable**: Through mandatory documentation and clear effects
- **Composable**: Via trait system and pipe operator

The online store example demonstrates how these features work together to create a robust, scalable, and maintainable system that leverages the best of functional programming, category theory, and the BEAM runtime.
