# Automated Regression Testing System Summary

**Date**: 2025-11-15
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Branch**: `feature/trait-system-syntax`

---

## Overview

Implemented automated, data-driven regression test system to ensure removed operators and syntax features never accidentally get reintroduced during development.

**Test File**: `test/compiler/parser/topos_parser_regression_tests.erl`
**Test Count**: 11 automated tests
**Result**: **11/11 passing** ✅

---

## System Architecture

### Data-Driven Design

The system uses **registries** to track removed features:

1. **`removed_operators()` Registry** - Tracks individual removed operators
2. **`removed_syntax_features()` Registry** - Tracks removed feature groups

**Key Benefit**: Adding new regression tests is as simple as adding an entry to the registry. No new test functions needed!

### Registry Entry Format

Each removed operator entry contains:

```erlang
#{
    operator => "<$>",                  % The syntax string
    name => "Functor fmap operator",    % Human-readable name
    removed_in => "Task 1.1.7",         % When it was removed
    reason => "Category theory...",     % Why it was removed
    expected_behavior => lexer_error,   % How it should behave now
    error_pattern => {illegal, "$"}     % Expected error (if lexer_error)
}
```

Or for operators that tokenize as separate tokens:

```erlang
#{
    operator => "<>",
    name => "Semigroup concat operator",
    removed_in => "Task 1.1.7",
    reason => "Category theory operators removed",
    expected_behavior => separate_tokens,
    expected_tokens => [lt, gt]         % Expected separate tokens
}
```

## Current Registered Removals

### Removed Operators (6 total)

| Operator | Name | Removed In | Behavior | Details |
|----------|------|------------|----------|---------|
| `<$>` | Functor fmap | Task 1.1.7 | Lexer error | `$` is illegal character |
| `<>` | Semigroup concat | Task 1.1.7 | Separate tokens | `< >` (lt, gt) |
| `>>=` | Monad bind | Task 1.1.7 | Separate tokens | `> >=` (gt, gte) |
| `<*>` | Applicative ap | Task 1.1.7 | Separate tokens | `< * >` (lt, star, gt) |
| `>=>` | Kleisli left-to-right | Task 1.1.7 | Separate tokens | `>= >` (gte, gt) |
| `<=<` | Kleisli right-to-left | Task 1.1.7 | Separate tokens | `< =<` (lte, lt) |

### Removed Features (1 total)

| Feature | Description | Removed In | Operators |
|---------|-------------|------------|-----------|
| category_theory_operators | Category theory operator set | Task 1.1.7 | `<$>`, `<>`, `>>=`, `<*>`, `>=>`, `<=<` |

---

## Test Categories

### 1. Individual Operator Regression Tests (6 tests)

Automatically generated from `removed_operators()` registry.

**Tests**:
1. ✅ Functor fmap operator (`<$>`) stays removed
2. ✅ Semigroup concat operator (`<>`) stays removed
3. ✅ Monad bind operator (`>>=`) stays removed
4. ✅ Applicative ap operator (`<*>`) stays removed
5. ✅ Kleisli left-to-right operator (`>=>`) stays removed
6. ✅ Kleisli right-to-left operator (`<=<`) stays removed

**How it works**: For each registry entry, the system:
- Tests the operator in context (e.g., `x <$> y`)
- Verifies expected behavior (lexer error or separate tokens)
- Checks that old single-token form doesn't exist
- Reports pass/fail for that specific operator

### 2. Comprehensive Summary Test (1 test)

**Test**: `all_removed_operators_test()`

Runs all operators through verification and provides summary report:

```
========================================
Removed Operators Regression Test
========================================
Testing 6 removed operators...

✓ Functor fmap operator (<$>) - correctly removed
✓ Semigroup concat operator (<>) - correctly removed
✓ Monad bind operator (>>=) - correctly removed
✓ Applicative ap operator (<*>) - correctly removed
✓ Kleisli left-to-right operator (>=>) - correctly removed
✓ Kleisli right-to-left operator (<=<) - correctly removed

========================================
Results: 6/6 operators verified
========================================
```

### 3. Feature-Level Regression Tests (1 test)

**Test**: Category theory operators feature stays removed

Verifies that **all operators** in a removed feature group stay removed.

**How it works**:
- Reads operators list from feature registry
- Looks up each operator in `removed_operators()`
- Verifies each one is properly removed
- Ensures no operator is accidentally missed

### 4. Documentation Validation Tests (2 tests)

**Tests**:
1. ✅ `removed_operators_documentation_test()` - Validates registry completeness
2. ✅ `removed_operators_by_task_test()` - Groups and reports removals by task

**Validation checks**:
- All required fields present
- `expected_behavior` is valid (`lexer_error` or `separate_tokens`)
- Appropriate pattern/tokens field exists
- No duplicate operator strings
- No duplicate feature names

**Sample output**:
```
========================================
Removed Operators by Task
========================================
Task 1.1.7: 6 operators
========================================
```

### 5. Registry Validity Test (1 test)

**Test**: `registry_validity_test()`

Ensures the registries themselves are valid:
- Registries not empty
- All operator strings unique
- All feature names unique

## How to Add New Removals

### Adding a Removed Operator

When removing an operator in the future, simply add an entry to `removed_operators()`:

```erlang
removed_operators() ->
    [
        %% Existing entries...

        %% NEW ENTRY - Example
        #{
            operator => "@@",
            name => "Double-at decorator operator",
            removed_in => "Task 2.3.4",
            reason => "Replaced with @decorator syntax",
            expected_behavior => lexer_error,
            error_pattern => {illegal, "@"}
        }
    ].
```

**That's it!** Tests will automatically:
- Generate a new test for this operator
- Include it in the comprehensive summary
- Validate the documentation
- Check for duplicates

### Adding a Removed Feature

When removing a feature group:

```erlang
removed_syntax_features() ->
    [
        %% Existing entries...

        %% NEW ENTRY - Example
        #{
            feature => "experimental_effects",
            description => "Experimental effect system syntax",
            removed_in => "Task 3.1.2",
            reason => "Replaced with trait-based effect system",
            operators => ["effect", "handle", "resume"]
        }
    ].
```

### Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all regression tests
rebar3 eunit --module=topos_parser_regression_tests

# Or with Erlang directly
erlc -I . -o test/compiler/parser test/compiler/parser/topos_parser_regression_tests.erl
erl -noshell -pa test/compiler/parser -pa src/compiler -eval \
  'eunit:test(topos_parser_regression_tests, [verbose])' -s init stop
```

---

## Verification Mechanisms

### For `lexer_error` Operators

Example: `<$>` with `$` being illegal

```erlang
verify_operator_removed(#{
    operator := "<$>",
    expected_behavior := lexer_error,
    error_pattern := {illegal, "$"}
})
```

**Verification**:
1. Tokenize `x <$> y`
2. Expect lexer error
3. Verify error matches `{illegal, "$"}`

### For `separate_tokens` Operators

Example: `<>` tokenizing as `< >`

```erlang
verify_operator_removed(#{
    operator := "<>",
    expected_behavior := separate_tokens,
    expected_tokens => [lt, gt]
})
```

**Verification**:
1. Tokenize `x <> y`
2. Extract token types
3. Verify `lt` and `gt` are present
4. Verify no single `concat` token exists

---

## Design Decisions

### Why Data-Driven Tests?

**Decision**: Use registry-based approach instead of individual test functions

**Rationale**:
1. **Scalability**: Adding new tests requires only data, not code
2. **Maintainability**: Central location for all removal documentation
3. **Automation**: Tests automatically generated from registry
4. **Documentation**: Registry serves as specification
5. **Consistency**: All tests follow same pattern

**Alternative Considered**: Individual test functions for each operator
**Rejected**: Too much boilerplate, hard to maintain, no single source of truth

### Why Two Behavior Types?

**Decision**: Support both `lexer_error` and `separate_tokens` behaviors

**Rationale**:
1. Some operators have illegal characters (`<$>` with `$`)
2. Others are valid token combinations (`<>` as `< >`)
3. Both need regression prevention
4. Different verification approaches needed

### Why Track Removal Context?

**Decision**: Include `removed_in` and `reason` fields

**Rationale**:
1. **Historical record**: Understand when and why removal happened
2. **Decision tracking**: Preserve rationale for future reference
3. **Reversal capability**: Easy to find if need to bring back
4. **Communication**: New developers understand the change

## Examples

### Example 1: Lexer Error Verification

```erlang
%% Registry entry
#{
    operator => "<$>",
    expected_behavior => lexer_error,
    error_pattern => {illegal, "$"}
}

%% Test source
"x <$> y"

%% Expected result
{error, {1, topos_lexer, {illegal, "$"}}, 1}

%% Verification
✓ Returns error
✓ Error matches pattern
```

### Example 2: Separate Tokens Verification

```erlang
%% Registry entry
#{
    operator => ">>=",
    expected_behavior => separate_tokens,
    expected_tokens => [gt, gte]  % Tokenizes as > >=
}

%% Test source
"x >>= y"

%% Expected tokens
[{lower_ident, 1, "x"}, {gt, 1}, {gte, 1}, {lower_ident, 1, "y"}]

%% Verification
✓ Contains gt token
✓ Contains gte token
✓ Does NOT contain bind token
```

## Developer Guide

### Quick Start

**To verify all removals still removed**:
```bash
rebar3 eunit --module=topos_parser_regression_tests
```

**To add a new removal**:
1. Add entry to `removed_operators()` in the test file
2. Run tests - new test automatically created
3. Commit both code change and test registry update

**To check removal history**:
Run the `removed_operators_by_task_test()` - it prints a summary.

### Best Practices

1. **Add removal immediately**: When removing an operator, add registry entry in same commit
2. **Include context**: Always fill in `removed_in` and `reason` fields
3. **Verify behavior**: Test the code to confirm `expected_behavior` is correct
4. **Group related removals**: Use feature registry for coordinated removals

### Troubleshooting

**Test fails with "Expected token not found"**:
- Check actual tokenization with `topos_lexer:string/1`
- Update `expected_tokens` to match actual behavior
- Operators may tokenize differently than expected

**Test fails with wrong error pattern**:
- Verify the actual lexer error
- Update `error_pattern` to match

**Registry validity fails**:
- Check for duplicate operator strings
- Ensure all required fields present
- Verify `expected_behavior` is valid value
