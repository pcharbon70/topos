/feature Implement task 1.1.1 of the phase-01.md plan. Do not forget to create a new git branch. Do not forget to write a
  planning document in notes/features. Do not forget to write appropriate unit tests for the code you write. Tests must be
  passing to consider your work done. Once done do not forget to write your summary document in notes/summaries. Then and only then ask me for permission to commit.
