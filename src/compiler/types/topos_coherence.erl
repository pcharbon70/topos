%%% @doc Coherence Checking for Trait Instances
%%%
%%% This module implements coherence checking to ensure that trait
%%% instance resolution is unambiguous. The coherence property guarantees
%%% that for any constraint, at most one instance matches.
%%%
%%% Key Concepts:
%%% - Coherence: No overlapping instances (unique resolution)
%%% - Overlap: Two instances that could match the same constraint
%%% - Orphan Instances: Instances defined outside trait or type module
%%%
%%% Coherence Rules:
%%% 1. No overlapping instances for the same trait
%%% 2. Instance heads must not unify (except for identical instances)
%%% 3. More specific instances are preferred over general ones
%%%
%%% @end
