# Task 1.1.1: Effect Keywords Integration

**Date**: 2025-11-09
**Branch**: `feature/task-1.1.1-effect-keywords`
**Status**: Complete - Awaiting Commit Approval

## Overview

Updated the Topos lexer (Task 1.1.1: Token Recognition) to support the algebraic effects system keywords that were recently integrated into the proof-of-concept planning documents (Phase 1-5).

## Motivation

The Phase 01 planning document was updated to include algebraic effects as a core language feature. The existing lexer implementation needed to be enhanced to recognize the five new effect-related keywords required by this design.

## Changes Made

### 1. Lexer Definition (`src/compiler/lexer/topos_lexer.xrl`)

Added five new keyword rules after the existing keywords section (line 79):

```erlang
%% Effect system keywords (Task 1.1.5)
effect : {token, {effect, TokenLine}}.
operation : {token, {operation, TokenLine}}.
perform : {token, {perform, TokenLine}}.
try : {token, {'try', TokenLine}}.
with : {token, {with, TokenLine}}.
```

### 2. Test Cases (`test/topos_lexer_tests.erl`)

Added two new test functions to validate effect keyword recognition:

#### Basic Keyword Test
```erlang
effect_keywords_test() ->
    %% Test effect system keywords (Task 1.1.5)
    Input = "effect operation perform try with",
    {ok, Tokens} = topos_lexer:tokenize(Input),
    Expected = [effect, operation, perform, 'try', with],
    ?assertEqual(Expected, token_types(Tokens)).
```

#### Comprehensive Syntax Test
```erlang
effect_syntax_test() ->
    %% Test effect declaration syntax (Task 1.1.5)
    Code = "effect FileIO\n"
           "  operation readFile\n"
           "end\n"
           "flow loadConfig = perform FileIO readFile\n"
           "try\n"
           "  loadConfig\n"
           "with FileIO",
    {ok, Tokens} = topos_lexer:tokenize(Code),
    %% Verify effect keywords are recognized
    EffectCount = length([T || T = {effect, _} <- Tokens]),
    OperationCount = length([T || T = {operation, _} <- Tokens]),
    PerformCount = length([T || T = {perform, _} <- Tokens]),
    TryCount = length([T || T = {'try', _} <- Tokens]),
    WithCount = length([T || T = {with, _} <- Tokens]),
    ?assertEqual(1, EffectCount),
    ?assertEqual(1, OperationCount),
    ?assertEqual(1, PerformCount),
    ?assertEqual(1, TryCount),
    ?assertEqual(1, WithCount).
```

### 3. Lexer Regeneration

Regenerated the lexer using the build script:
```bash
./scripts/build_lexer.sh
```

This produced `src/compiler/lexer/topos_lexer_gen.erl` with the updated token patterns.

### 4. Wrapper Module Restoration

During testing, discovered that the wrapper module (`src/compiler/lexer/topos_lexer.erl`) had been inadvertently overwritten. Restored the correct version from git commit `c4cb6d5` which includes:
- Public API functions: `tokenize/1`, `tokenize_file/1`
- Comment filtering with nested comment support
- Resource limit getters: `get_max_input_size/0`, `get_max_nesting_depth/0`, `get_max_identifier_length/0`

## Test Results

All 70 tests passed successfully, including the two new effect keyword tests:

```
======================== EUnit ========================
module 'topos_lexer_tests'
  ...
  topos_lexer_tests: effect_keywords_test...ok
  ...
  topos_lexer_tests: effect_syntax_test...ok
  ...
  [done in 0.712 s]
=======================================================
  All 70 tests passed.
```

## Files Modified

1. `src/compiler/lexer/topos_lexer.xrl` - Added 5 effect keyword rules
2. `src/compiler/lexer/topos_lexer_gen.erl` - Regenerated from .xrl file
3. `src/compiler/lexer/topos_lexer.erl` - Restored correct wrapper module
4. `test/topos_lexer_tests.erl` - Added 2 new test cases

## Files Created

1. `notes/features/effect-keywords-lexer.md` - Comprehensive planning document
2. `summaries/task-1.1.1-effect-keywords-integration.md` - This summary

## Technical Details

### Effect Keywords

The five new keywords support the algebraic effects system:

- `effect` - Declares an effect interface with operations
- `operation` - Defines an operation within an effect
- `perform` - Invokes an effect operation
- `try` - Begins a try-with effect handler block
- `with` - Specifies the effect handler for a try block

### Example Usage

```topos
effect FileIO
  operation readFile : String -> Result String Error
  operation writeFile : String -> String -> Result Unit Error
end

flow loadConfig =
  perform FileIO readFile "config.topos"

flow main =
  try
    loadConfig
  with FileIO
    | readFile path -> pure (defaultConfig)
    | writeFile path content -> pure ()
  end
```

## Integration with Planning Documents

This implementation directly supports Phase 01, Section 1.1 (Lexer), Task 1.1.5 (Effect Keywords) as outlined in `notes/planning/proof-of-concept/phase-01.md`:

> **Task 1.1.5: Effect Keywords**
>
> Recognize effect system keywords introduced in the effect system design. These keywords enable algebraic effects, which provide structured effect management while maintaining the functional programming model.

## Risk Assessment

**Risk Level**: LOW

The changes are minimal and localized:
- 5 new keyword rules in lexer definition
- Standard keyword pattern matching
- Comprehensive test coverage
- No impact on existing functionality (all 68 original tests still pass)

## Next Steps

1. Await user approval for commit
2. Commit changes to `feature/task-1.1.1-effect-keywords` branch
3. Implementation of effect system parser rules (Task 1.2.5)
4. Implementation of effect system type checker (Task 1.3.5)
